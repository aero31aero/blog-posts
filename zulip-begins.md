# Zulip Summer of Code
I would be interning at Zulip in the summers of 2017, and it has been pretty eventful already. So here's a brief of how I started contributing to Zulip and what I plan to work on.

## Finding Zulip
It all begain in October when my friend and WikiToLearn hacker Srijan Agarwal invited me to try contributing to a live editor for WikiToLearn. I had been trying unsuccessfully to get the developer environment for WikiToLearn up and running but failng to that for quite some time because of some dependency issues when I finally decided to give up on it.
